# NeverEndingQuest

## Launch the game: React by default

After installation, run these commands from your game folder with its Python
environment activated:

- **React player (default):** `python run_web.py`
- **Legacy player (explicit opt-in):** `python run_web.py --ui legacy`

For Windows installer users, run `launch_game.bat` for React, or
`launch_game.bat --ui legacy` for legacy.

Both interfaces open in your browser. React is selected automatically; there is
no interface-selection prompt and no automatic fallback to legacy. If React needs
setup or repair, follow the launcher's instructions, or explicitly run legacy.
Node.js/npm are needed to build or rebuild React, not to run an already-current
build or the legacy player. See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for installation.

**Version 0.3.5 (Alpha)**

An AI-powered Dungeon Master for running SRD 5.2.1 compatible tabletop RPG campaigns with infinite adventure potential. Experience the world's most popular roleplaying game with an intelligent AI that remembers every decision, adapts to your playstyle, and creates endless adventures tailored to your party.

**🚀 NEW: React Player and Multi-Provider AI** - The component-based React player
is now the default; the established legacy player remains an explicit launch option.
Run the game with the current
cost-optimized OpenAI GPT-5.x models (**the new default**), the stable GPT-4.1
baseline (one toggle away), Gemini, or an OpenAI-compatible local or remote
server.

## Quick Start

### 🎯 One-Click Windows Installer (Recommended)

**For non-technical users on Windows:**

1. **Download the installer**: [install_neverendingquest_windows.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonlightByte/NeverEndingQuest/main/install_neverendingquest_windows.bat)
   - **Right-click the link** and select **"Save link as..."** or **"Save target as..."**
   - Save the `.bat` file to your computer (e.g., Downloads folder)
2. **Run the installer**: Double-click the `.bat` file
3. **Choose whether to add an OpenAI API key**: Enter one in the popup, or skip
   it and configure a provider later from the in-game Settings panel
4. **Launch the game**: Run `launch_game.bat` in the `NeverEndingQuest` folder

The installer automatically:
- ✅ Checks Python/Git and offers Node.js LTS installation with your consent
- ✅ Clones the repository to a `NeverEndingQuest` folder
- ✅ Creates a virtual environment
- ✅ Installs all dependencies
- ✅ Creates the local configuration and offers an optional OpenAI-key dialog
- ✅ Builds React and creates a React-default `launch_game.bat`; explicit legacy remains available

**To restart the game later:**
- Run `launch_game.bat` in the `NeverEndingQuest` installation folder

---

### 🛠️ Manual Installation

The launcher handles React setup automatically after the Python environment is
ready:

1. **Install Python dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Install Node.js LTS**: Required only for the React player; it includes `npm`
3. **Create local configuration**: Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py`
4. **Launch React**: Run `python run_web.py`
5. **Choose an AI provider**: Open **Settings → AI Provider** in either player
6. **Start your adventure**: The game guides you through character creation and module selection

### Additional Launch Options

- **React Player (default)**: `python run_web.py` or `python run_web.py --ui react`
- **Explicit Legacy Player**: `python run_web.py --ui legacy`
- **Old shortcuts**: `--ui choose` is a deprecated React alias, without a selection menu
- **Module Toolkit**: `python launch_toolkit.py` - Opens directly to the module creation interface
- **Terminal Mode**: `python main.py` - Classic text-based interface (limited features)

The launcher installs locked frontend dependencies and builds missing, incomplete,
or outdated React assets. A current usable build needs no Node.js/npm. Failed
preparation preserves the previous published bundle and gives repair instructions;
it never silently launches legacy. To skip React prerequisites, explicitly run
`python run_web.py --ui legacy`. The toolkit and terminal also remain Node-free.

The Windows installer checks the fetched checkout's complete dependency requirements
and asks before installing/updating Node.js LTS. Declining completes base setup,
then offers a separate choice to launch legacy or exit. After installing Node,
open a new terminal if PATH still resolves an older version. Node.js is not a
Python `requirements.txt` dependency.

The server prints the exact address when it starts. A fresh configuration uses
`http://localhost:8357`; if you change `WEB_PORT` in `config.py`, use the port
shown by the launcher. React is served at `/play/`; `/` redirects there unless
the server was explicitly started with `--ui legacy`.

### AI Provider Setup

Open **Settings → AI Provider** and choose one of these modes:

- **OpenAI (GPT-5.x)** — *default*: The current, cost-optimized model matrix.
  Requires an OpenAI API key.
- **Legacy (GPT-4.1)**: The previous stable baseline, kept as a one-click toggle.
  Requires an OpenAI API key.
- **Gemini 3.1**: Uses Gemini models selected per call site. Requires a Google AI API key.
- **Local / Custom Server**: Connects to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as
  LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter, or another remote server.
- **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth**: Uses the official Codex app-server and the models
  available to your ChatGPT-authenticated Codex account. It does not use an
  OpenAI API key for game text.

#### ChatGPT / Codex OAuth

This optional provider runs NeverEndingQuest text-generation calls through the
official [Codex app-server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server).
Codex owns the ChatGPT sign-in flow, stores and refreshes its credentials, and
performs inference. NeverEndingQuest does not read `~/.codex/auth.json`, copy
ChatGPT tokens, or store those credentials in `user_settings.json`.

1. Install a current [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) and
   confirm `codex --version` works in the environment that launches the game.
   Set `CODEX_BINARY` to the executable path if `codex` is not on `PATH`.
2. Open **Settings → AI Provider** and choose **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth**.
3. Select **Sign in with ChatGPT**, open the displayed verification URL, and
   enter the device code. The persistent app-server completes and maintains the
   official login.
4. Select **Refresh Models** after sign-in. The model dropdowns are populated
   from Codex's `model/list` result for that account and plan.

Codex authentication, saved routes, and inference remain independent of the
OpenAI API provider. For **Automatic** routing, NeverEndingQuest mirrors each
call site's current tested OpenAI model id, reasoning effort, and retry ladder
when that model is also present in the authenticated Codex catalogue. If the
exact model is unavailable to the ChatGPT account, the Codex account default is
used. Reasoning effort is changed only when the discovered model does not
support the requested level.

The four Codex-only capability tiers, **cheap**, **balanced**, **strong**, and
**premium**, provide manual model overrides. Selecting a model for a tier
changes only Codex requests in that tier and does not alter the OpenAI, Gemini,
Legacy, or Local provider matrices. Leaving a tier on **Automatic** preserves
the OpenAI-matched per-call-site behavior. The game does not embed today's
Codex catalogue as permanent application logic.

Newly discovered models are offered for manual selection but do not replace a
healthy saved route automatically. If a configured model disappears, the
adapter selects the nearest configured available tier, then the account default
if necessary. The UI reports the unavailable model and temporary replacement.
When **Automatically replace unavailable models** is enabled, only that broken
route is updated. Use **Refresh Models** to re-check availability at any time.

Every NeverEndingQuest request starts a fresh ephemeral Codex thread, injects
the exact game-managed context for that call, and uses a read-only, no-approval
execution policy. Codex does not maintain a second game conversation. Strict
JSON schemas are forwarded as app-server `outputSchema` where a call site
provides one, and results are normalized back to the existing OpenAI-style
`response.choices[0].message.content`, `response.model`, and `response.usage`
contract.

ChatGPT/Codex availability and limits depend on the signed-in account. This is
separate from OpenAI API billing and credentials. OpenAI TTS and image features
still require the existing OpenAI API key when used. Developers with a local
authenticated Codex installation can run the optional live smoke test with:

```bash
NEQ_CODEX_LIVE_TEST=1 python -m pytest -q tests/test_codex_client.py
```

#### Why OpenAI (GPT-5.x) is now the default

The application no longer points every AI call at a single model. Each of the
~76 distinct AI call sites (main DM turns, combat refereeing, summaries,
validation, module generation, NPC coherence, and so on) is individually bound
to a specific model + reasoning setting that was chosen from blind quality/cost
evaluations. The default **OpenAI** provider routes the large majority of call
sites to the cheaper, faster `gpt-5.6-luna` (at the lowest reasoning tier that
still passed each site's tests), keeps `gpt-5.6-terra` where it measurably won,
and deliberately **retains the stronger `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.2`** on the two call
sites where the cheaper models regressed (combat refereeing and the initiative
tracker). The result is a large cost reduction versus the old GPT-5.2-everywhere
wiring, with no observed quality loss on the tested sites.

These bindings live in `model_registry.py` (`CALLSITE_BINDINGS`) and are the single
source of truth: every AI call is routed through `resolve_callsite_config(task_id,
provider)` at the shared call boundary, which sets the model + reasoning tier for that
call regardless of any older per-call-site constant. To confirm which model a call
actually used, read the response-derived record in
`debug/api_captures/api_calls_master.jsonl` (it logs `response.model`) — not a
pre-call routing snapshot.

**Prefer the old behavior?** Switch **Settings → AI Provider → Legacy (GPT-4.1)**
(or set `MODEL_PROVIDER = "legacy"` in `config.py`). The full GPT-4.1 /
GPT-4.1-mini path is unchanged and fully supported — nothing was removed, the
default just moved.

> ⚠️ **Feedback wanted on the new call-site bindings.** These model choices are
> new. If you notice a regression on the default OpenAI provider — worse
> narration, broken combat math, malformed JSON/updates, a stuck build, or any
> behavior that improves the moment you toggle back to **Legacy (GPT-4.1)** —

> That points us straight at the responsible call site so we can retune just
> that binding. In the meantime, Legacy is always a safe fallback.

For Local / Custom Server, the default endpoint is
`http://localhost:1234/v1`. The model name and API key are optional for local
servers; remote services may require both. Save the endpoint and select **Test
Connection** before starting a game.

> ⚙️ **Turn "thinking" / reasoning OFF for local models (recommended).** If you
> run **LM Studio** (or another local server) with a model that has a "thinking"
> or reasoning mode, **disable it on the loaded model** before starting a game.
> NeverEndingQuest's call sites are already highly structured (compression,
> validation, summaries, combat bookkeeping), so chain-of-thought adds little and
> costs a lot: a mechanical history-compression call that returns in a few seconds
> with thinking off can take 10x longer with it on, and on a long game the startup
> compression pass can run so long it trips the transport liveness boundary and
> retries — leaving you stuck before the first prompt. Disabling thinking makes
> the same call return in seconds with no loss of gameplay quality. In LM Studio,
> switch the loaded model's reasoning/thinking setting to off (some models expose
> it as a per-model toggle; others via the model's parameters).
>
> The same preference **often applies to the OpenAI providers**: the default
> matrix already binds most call sites to the lowest reasoning tier that passed
> each site's tests. Higher reasoning is retained only where it measurably won.

The selected provider and non-secret endpoint settings persist in
`user_settings.json`. Keys entered through Settings use the operating system's
credential store when one is available. On a headless system without a usable
credential store, keys remain only in memory for the current process and must
be entered again after a restart. Existing keys in the local, gitignored
`config.py` remain supported.

> **Note**: The game is designed for the **web interface** which provides the optimal experience with real-time updates, character sheets, visual portraits, and the module toolkit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js LTS (required for the React player; legacy remains available without it)
- One AI provider: OpenAI, Gemini, ChatGPT-authenticated Codex, or a local OpenAI-compatible server such as LM Studio
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoonlightByte/NeverEndingQuest.git
   cd NeverEndingQuest
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Install Node.js LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you want the
   React player. The launcher handles `npm ci` and the production build.

3. **Create the local configuration**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   cp config_template.py config.py

   # Windows Command Prompt
   copy config_template.py config.py
   ```

   Provider selection and credentials can then be configured from **Settings →
   AI Provider**. Do not commit `config.py` or any API keys.

4. **Launch the game**
   ```bash
   # Default React player
   python run_web.py

   # React player (automatically builds frontend assets when needed)
   python run_web.py --ui react

   # Explicit legacy player (does not require Node.js)
   python run_web.py --ui legacy

   # Module Toolkit directly
   python launch_toolkit.py

   # Terminal interface (basic)
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the URL printed by the launcher. With the unchanged template, explicit legacy
   opens at `http://localhost:8357/`, React at
   `http://localhost:8357/play/`, and the toolkit at
   `http://localhost:8357/toolkit`.

### First Time Setup
- Open Settings and select/test your AI provider before starting the game
- The AI wizard will guide you through character creation
- Choose from pre-built modules or generate a custom adventure
- Both web players use the same game state; React provides the component-based
  interface while legacy remains available through explicit boot selection

## How It Overcomes AI Limitations

### The Context Window Challenge
Traditional AI systems have limited memory - typically 100-200k tokens. In a text-heavy RPG, this means:
- Conversations get truncated after a few hours of play
- NPCs "forget" your previous interactions
- Story continuity breaks between sessions
- Module transitions lose important context

### Our Solution: Intelligent Conversation Compression

NeverEndingQuest implements a sophisticated compression pipeline that maintains full contextual understanding:

#### 1. **Living Summary Generation & Chronicle System**
- Each module generates a comprehensive living summary upon exit that captures the complete adventure
- AI analyzes the entire module conversation and creates beautifully written fantasy prose summaries
- Living summaries are completely regenerated (not appended) on each visit to incorporate new experiences
- Original events preserved in elevated narrative form while reducing tokens by 85-90%
- **Chronicle Format**: Compressed histories are clearly labeled as "CHRONICLE" - these are historical records of actual gameplay, not metadata
- **Visit Evolution**: Summaries become richer and more detailed with each return visit
- **Single File System**: Always `[Module_Name]_summary_001.json` - never increments, always regenerates

#### 2. **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture with Module-Specific Conversations**
```
Module Structure:
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Thornwood   │────►│   Keep of   │────►│ Silver Vein │
│   Watch     │◄────│    Doom     │◄────│  Whispers   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                    │                    │
       └────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
                    Shared Context
                 (Character History)

Module Conversation Management:
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Current Module  │────►│ Module Archive  │
│ Conversation    │     │ (Auto-saved)    │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         ↓                       ↓
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ New Module      │◄────│ Previous Conv.  │
│ (Fresh Start)   │     │ (Auto-restored) │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

- Each module is a self-contained geographic region with its own conversation history
- **Module-Specific Conversations**: When leaving a module, conversations are archived and cleared
- **Automatic Restoration**: Returning to a module restores its specific conversation history
- **Prevents Infinite Buildup**: Each module maintains its own context bubble, preventing token explosion
- Return to any location with full memory of past events specific to that module

#### 3. **Living World Persistence with Smart Summary Management**
- **NPC Memory**: Characters remember your entire relationship history through living summaries
- **Dynamic NPC Context**: Real-time NPC discovery system provides complete context for AI interactions
- **Validation-Aware NPCs**: Automatic NPC tracking prevents hallucination and ensures consistency
- **Incremental Conversation Compression**: Intelligent compression preserves recent context while reducing token usage
- **Decision Consequences**: Past choices affect future module availability
- **World State Tracking**: Completed quests permanently change the world
- **Cross-Module Continuity**: Items, relationships, and reputation carry forward
- **Living Summary System**: Each module maintains a single, evolving summary that updates with each visit
- **Visit Tracking**: System tracks `visitCount`, `firstVisitDate`, and `lastVisitDate` for each module
- **Smart Context Injection**: Previous module summaries are injected as campaign context, excluding the current module to prevent duplication

### Benefits
- **Truly Infinite Campaigns**: Play for hundreds of hours without context loss across multiple adventures
- **Persistent Relationships**: NPCs remember you after months of real-time play through living summaries
- **Coherent Storytelling**: Every adventure builds on previous experiences with complete cross-module continuity
- **Zero Context Contamination**: Each module maintains its own conversation bubble, preventing token explosion
- **Seamless Module Returns**: Full conversation history restored when revisiting any module
- **Living World Evolution**: Summaries grow richer with each visit, tracking your expanding impact
- **Optimized Performance**: Module separation prevents infinite context growth while preserving complete history
- **Smart Context Management**: Campaign summaries provide relevant background without duplication
- **Visit Progression Tracking**: Rich metadata shows your journey across the world over time
- **Reduced API Costs**: 60-70% cost reduction through compression and intelligent model routing

## Advanced Token Compression System

### 🌟 CORE FEATURE - Now Production Ready!
The Advanced Token Compression System has graduated from experimental to **CORE FEATURE** status in v0.3.0. This revolutionary technology is now the foundation of NeverEndingQuest's AI architecture, enabling unprecedented cost savings and local model compatibility while maintaining complete game fidelity.

### Key Benefits
- **Cost Reduction**: 60-70% reduction in OpenAI API costs through compression and intelligent routing
- **Open-Source Compatibility**: Reduced context from 100K+ to under 10K tokens enables local model deployment
- **Performance**: Faster inference times with smaller contexts
- **Scalability**: Support for longer play sessions without context overflow
- **Local Deployment**: Run the game on consumer GPUs with a local model such as Gemma 4 12B

### Compression Technologies

#### 1. Parallel Conversation Compression (`core/ai/conversation_compression.py`)
The system uses advanced parallel processing to compress conversation history in real-time:

- **Parallel Processing**: ThreadPoolExecutor with up to 5 workers for concurrent compression
- **Smart Caching**: MD5 hash-based caching prevents re-compression of identical messages
- **Selective Compression**: Preserves last 2 user messages for immediate context while compressing older history
- **Token Reduction**: Achieves 76-82% reduction per message while maintaining narrative continuity
- **Configuration**: Toggle system-wide with `COMPRESSION_ENABLED` flag in `config.py`

**Performance Metrics:**
- Average compression ratio: 76-82% per message
- Processing speed: 5 messages compressed simultaneously
- Cache hit rate: ~40% in typical gameplay

#### 2. Compressed System Prompts
Revolutionary @TAG machine language format reduces prompt sizes by 87-92%:

**`system_prompt_compressed.txt`**: Main game prompt
- Original: 101,000 characters
- Compressed: 8,000 characters
- Reduction: 92%

**`validation_prompt_compressed.txt`**: Validation prompt
- Original: 48,000 characters
- Compressed: 6,500 characters
- Reduction: 87%

**Compression Methodology:**
```
@FMT: Formatting rules and output constraints
@ACTIONS: Available game actions with exact parameter contracts
@PARAMS: Precise parameter specifications
@OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS: ASCII-only enforcement (Windows compatibility)
@EXAMPLES: Action usage examples
```

This structured notation maintains all game rules while dramatically reducing token usage.

#### 3. Module Transition Compression
Intelligent conversation archiving during module transitions:

- **Automatic Archiving**: Conversations compressed when transitioning between adventure modules
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Beautiful prose summaries preserve adventure context
- **Chronological Timeline**: Complete adventure history maintained across all modules
- **Smart Segmentation**: Two-condition boundary detection for optimal compression points
- **Implementation**: `check_and_process_module_transitions()` in `main.py`

#### 4. Combat Message Compression
Special handling for verbose combat narration:

- **Combat Narration**: Reduces messages from 4,630 to ~850 characters (82% reduction)
- **Dice Preservation**: Maintains all dice rolls and damage calculations for validation
- **State Tracking**: Preserves `preroll_cache` and combat state for rule compliance
- **Fidelity**: Full combat mechanics preserved despite compression

Example:
```
Original: "The orc chieftain raises his massive battle-axe high above his head, muscles rippling with primal fury as he brings it down in a devastating arc toward your shoulder. The blade bites deep into your armor... [4,630 chars]"

Compressed: "Orc chieftain attacks with battle-axe. Hit: 18 vs AC 16. Damage: 2d8+5=13 slashing. You: 45->32 HP. Status: wounded, bleeding (1d4/turn)... [850 chars]"
```

#### 5. Action Prediction & Per-Call-Site Model Routing (`utils/action_predictor.py`)

NeverEndingQuest no longer uses one model setting for every AI request. The
selected provider supplies a tested model configuration for each call site,
including narration, action prediction, structured character updates, combat,
summaries, validation, module creation, and transitions.

- **Legacy** preserves the GPT-4.1 behavior used as the stable baseline.
- **OpenAI** and **Gemini** use task-specific models and reasoning settings.
- **Local / Custom Server** sends the same gameplay contracts through an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint using the configured local model.
- Provider changes apply at runtime and persist for the next launch.

Action prediction still decides whether a turn requires structured game-state
operations, but users do not need to assign models manually. The authoritative
per-call-site configuration lives in `model_config.py`.

### Configuration & Setup

#### Compression Configuration

Compression is enabled by default. Advanced developers can inspect its master
switch and the provider/call-site model matrix in `model_config.py`. The older
single-model and mini-model settings shown in previous README versions are no
longer the source of truth.

#### Monitoring & Telemetry
The system includes comprehensive telemetry for optimization:

- **Usage Tracking**: `openai_usage_tracker.py` logs all API calls
- **Token Analytics**: Per-endpoint token consumption statistics
- **Spike Detection**: Automatic detection of usage anomalies
- **Migration Planning**: Data for transitioning to local models
- **Log Location**: `telemetry_log.jsonl` for analysis

### Open-Source Model Compatibility

The compression system enables deployment with open-source models:

#### Compatible Models
- **Gemma 4 12B** (`google/gemma-4-12b-qat`): the smallest verified local model
- Other models are not recommended at this time; see the Local / Custom Server
  section for what was verified and what is known not to work
- **Solar**: 10K context window

#### Local Deployment Benefits
- **GPU Requirements**: Reduced from 48GB to 8-16GB VRAM
- **Inference Speed**: 3-5x faster with compressed contexts
- **Memory Usage**: 80% reduction in RAM requirements
- **Batch Processing**: Support for multiple concurrent games

#### Local / Custom Server Setup

NeverEndingQuest can connect to LM Studio and other OpenAI-compatible servers
without a special launcher:

1. Start the server and load a model.
2. Launch either web player.
3. Open **Settings → AI Provider** and choose **Local / Custom Server**.
4. Enter the base URL, normally `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio.
5. Optionally enter a model identifier and API key. Local servers commonly need
   neither; hosted compatible services commonly require both.
6. Select **Save**, then **Test Connection**.

Connection success proves endpoint compatibility, not full gameplay quality.
Local models must follow long prompts, compressed tags, and structured game
contracts reliably; combat and game-state updates are the most demanding paths.
The Legacy GPT-4.1 provider remains the recommended quality baseline.

**Local model compatibility (verified 2026-09-13, LM Studio 0.4.24):**

- **Smallest recommended local model: `google/gemma-4-12b-qat` (Gemma 4 12B).**
  It completes character creation and plays the main loop with correct rules
  (Standard Array, racial bonuses, armor class) and one review round per answer.
- **Not supported: `qwen/qwen3.5-9b`.** It cannot follow the game's prompt and
  schema contracts: it fabricates rules (a made-up "Standard Array with Human
  bonuses"), rejects correct player answers, and loops in the character-creation
  review without ever finalizing a character. The connection test passes; the
  game does not. Models that fail this way are a prompt/schema-adherence
  problem, not a connection problem, and no server setting fixes them.
- Other local models are not recommended at this time. Smaller or weaker
  instruction-following models than Gemma 4 12B should be expected to fail the
  same way.

#### 🧪 LM Studio Compatibility Notes

NeverEndingQuest supports LM Studio through its OpenAI-compatible API. Local
model behavior varies substantially by model, quantization, context size, and
hardware.

**⚠️ Important limitations:**

- Local models may produce malformed structured actions or inconsistent rules interpretations.
- Character updates, combat, module transitions, and parallel requests require strong instruction following.
- Context and memory requirements grow during long campaigns; they cannot be inferred from a successful connection test.
- Performance and required RAM/VRAM depend on the chosen model, quantization, context, and server configuration.

Use the largest practical context window for your model and hardware. A small
context can be enough to test the connection while still being insufficient for
long sessions or complete prompt contracts. If you experience malformed JSON or
poor prompt adherence, try a stronger instruction-following model, a larger
context, or a lower server-side temperature.

**Possible local-model issues**:
- JSON parsing errors during complex combat or state updates
- Inconsistent action detection compared with the Legacy GPT-4.1 baseline
- May require manual intervention for edge cases
- Slower response times on CPU-only systems
- Parallel requests may cause response delays or errors

The older direct/proxy batch files and logging tools remain available for
advanced diagnosis, but they are no longer the primary setup path. For normal
play, configure and test the endpoint from Settings.

## Advanced Features

### How the Campaign World Works

#### Location-Based Module System
The game uses a revolutionary **geographic boundary system** instead of traditional campaign chapters:

- **Modules as Geographic Regions**: Each adventure module represents a geographic area network (village + forest + dungeon)
- **Organic World Growth**: The world map expands naturally as you add new modules - no predetermined geography needed
- **Automatic Transitions**: When you travel to a new area, the system automatically detects if you're entering a different module
- **Living World Memory**: Every location remembers your visits and the world evolves based on accumulated decisions

#### How Modules Connect
```
Example World Evolution:
Keep_of_Doom: Harrow's Hollow (village) → Gloamwood (forest) → Shadowfall Keep (ruins)
+ Crystal_Peaks: Frostspire Village (mountain town) → Ice Caverns (frozen depths)
= AI Connection: "Mountain paths from Harrow's Hollow lead to Frostspire Village"
```

The AI analyzes area descriptions and themes to suggest natural narrative bridges between modules.

#### Adventure Continuity
- **Chronicle System**: When you leave a module, the system generates a beautiful prose summary of your adventure
- **Context Accumulation**: Return visits include full history of previous adventures in that region
- **Character Relationships**: NPCs remember you across modules and adventures continue to evolve
- **Consequence Tracking**: Major decisions affect future adventures and available story paths

## Configuration

### AI Provider and Credentials

Use **Settings → AI Provider** in the web interface instead of assigning a
single model in `config.py`. Choose OpenAI (default), Legacy, Gemini, Local /
Custom Server, or ChatGPT / Codex OAuth. The application maintains its tested per-call-site model matrix in
`model_config.py`, and the active provider persists in `user_settings.json`.

- **Default provider is `openai`** (the cost-optimized GPT-5.x call-site matrix).
  Set `MODEL_PROVIDER = "legacy"` in `config.py`, or use the Settings panel, to
  run the GPT-4.1 baseline instead.
- Legacy and OpenAI require an OpenAI API key.
- Gemini requires a Google AI API key.
- Local endpoints generally do not require a key; hosted compatible endpoints may.
- ChatGPT / Codex OAuth uses Codex-managed ChatGPT authentication and a dynamic
  account catalogue. It does not use either API-key setting for game text.
- Use **Test Connection** after configuring a Local / Custom Server.
- Never commit `config.py`, `user_settings.json`, API keys, or captured provider traffic.

### Web Interface Settings
- **Port**: 8357 by default (set `WEB_PORT` in local `config.py` to change it)
- **Host**: Loopback-only by default. Advanced operators can set `NEQ_WEB_HOST`;
  exposing the server beyond the local computer also requires a long random
  `NEQ_OPERATOR_TOKEN`.
- **Debug Mode**: Disabled by default for production

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB for base install, more for packs
- **Network**: Internet connection for cloud providers; not required for a fully local endpoint
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)

## Community Module Safety

The module stitcher includes comprehensive safety protocols for community-created content:

### Automatic Safety Validation
- **Content Review**: AI analyzes all module content for family-friendly appropriateness
- **File Security**: Blocks executable files, oversized content, and malicious patterns
- **Schema Compliance**: Validates JSON structure against 5th edition schemas
- **ID Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves duplicate area/location identifiers

### How It Works
```
New module detected → Security scan → Content safety check → Schema validation → Conflict resolution → Integration
```

### For Module Creators
- Use unique area IDs to avoid conflicts
- Keep files under 10MB (JSON/text only)
- Create family-friendly content
- Follow SRD 5.2.1 schemas
- Test with validation tools
- Include module documentation

### For Players
- Download modules from trusted sources
- System provides multiple safety layers automatically
- All community modules undergo validation before integration
- Backup saves before adding new modules as good practice

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation
- **Module not found**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Provider authentication errors**: Open Settings, select the intended provider,
  and save the corresponding OpenAI or Gemini key. Existing `config.py` keys
  remain a supported fallback.
- **Python version**: Requires 3.9+ (`python --version`)
- **React says it is not built**: Install Node.js LTS, then relaunch with
  `python run_web.py --ui react`. The launcher will run the required npm install
  and build commands automatically.
- **React build fails**: Run `python run_web.py --check-frontend-tools` to check
  Node/npm against this checkout's locked dependencies. Install compatible Node.js
  LTS if needed, then retry `python run_web.py --prepare-frontend`. Alternatively,
  explicitly use `python run_web.py --ui legacy`; no automatic fallback occurs.

#### Startup Problems
- **No modules**: Check `modules/` directory exists
- **Web won't start**: Check the configured `WEB_PORT` (8357 by default) and
  confirm that another process is not already using it
- **Toolkit unavailable**: Ensure `core/toolkit/` exists
- **Local server fails connection test**: Confirm the server is running, use an
  OpenAI-compatible base URL ending in `/v1`, and verify the optional model name
  and API key required by that server

#### Performance
- **Slow responses**: Normal (10-30s for AI)
- **High memory**: Restart after long sessions

## Recent Updates

### Current Main - React Player, Multi-Provider AI, and Startup Improvements

#### Player Interfaces
- **Two supported web players**: React is the default at `/play/`; `/` redirects there unless the server is explicitly started with `--ui legacy`.
- **Shared game state**: Both players connect to the same Python game engine, saves, modules, and Socket.IO events.
- **Legacy feature/layout parity**: React includes the party and initiative strips,
  character/inventory/spells/NPC/debug panels, journal, save/load/reset/settings,
  combat state, and long-running operation overlays.
- **Reconnect hydration**: React restores authoritative game state after a browser refresh or Socket.IO reconnect.

#### Startup and Frontend Build
- **React default**: Plain `python run_web.py` opens React. Use `--ui legacy` for legacy; old `--ui choose` shortcuts now open React without a menu.
- **Automatic React preparation**: When React is requested, stale or missing assets trigger `npm ci` and `npm run build` automatically.
- **Explicit recovery**: Missing prerequisites or failed builds show repair instructions without starting another player. Existing published assets and saves are preserved.
- **Windows launcher**: `launch_game.bat` defaults to React and forwards arguments, including `--ui legacy`.

#### AI Providers and Local Credentials
- **Default provider is now OpenAI (GPT-5.x)**: The cost-optimized per-call-site
  matrix (`gpt-5.6-luna`/`terra`, with `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5.2` retained where they
  won) is the new out-of-the-box default. **Legacy (GPT-4.1) remains one toggle
  away** in Settings → AI Provider, or `MODEL_PROVIDER = "legacy"` in `config.py`.
  Nothing was removed — only the default moved. *Please report any call-site
  regression against the OpenAI default (see AI Provider Setup above); Legacy is a
  safe fallback.*
- **Provider selection in Settings**: Choose OpenAI (default), Legacy GPT-4.1, Gemini, or an OpenAI-compatible Local / Custom Server.
- **Per-call-site model matrix**: Narration, combat, validation, summaries, updates,
  and generation use provider-specific model settings selected for their task.
- **Local endpoint testing**: Save and test LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter, or other compatible endpoints from the UI.
- **Secret separation**: Provider keys entered through Settings use an available OS
  credential store and are not written to `user_settings.json`; headless fallback is process-memory only.

### Version 0.3.5 - DM Voice Text-to-Speech

#### DM Voice Feature
New text-to-speech system for immersive DM narration:
- **Dual Engine Support**: Choose between free browser voices or premium OpenAI TTS
- **Browser Engine (Free)**: Uses Web Speech API with system-installed voices (English/Spanish)
- **OpenAI Engine (Paid)**: High-quality AI voices with Standard and HD model options
- **Voice Selection**: Pick from multiple voices per engine with live preview
- **Auto-play Mode**: Automatically plays DM narration as messages arrive
- **Smart Caching**: OpenAI responses cached client-side to reduce API costs on replay
- **Settings Integration**: Consolidated settings dropdown with smooth animations

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Settings Dropdown**: Consolidated AI Images, DM Voice, and Model toggles into single dropdown
- **Accordion Animation**: Smooth expand/collapse for DM Voice settings section
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified button heights and spacing across chat interface
- **Custom Tooltips**: Styled tooltips matching existing UI patterns

### Version 0.3.0 - Token Compression System (First Iteration)

#### Token Compression System
First iteration of conversation compression technology:
- **Conversation compression**: Reduces token usage by approximately 70-90% in testing
- **Compressed system prompt**: 101K tokens → 8K tokens (~93% reduction)
- **Combat message compression**: ~70-85% compression rate
- **Validation prompt compression**: ~60-75% compression rate
- **Goal**: Enable local LLM usage in future iterations

#### Dynamic NPC Core Memory System
- **Real-time NPC Discovery**: Automatically scans all module files to build complete NPC context
- **Dynamic Context Building**: Creates comprehensive NPC presence data for AI validation
- **Location-Aware Tracking**: Knows exactly which NPCs are at each location
- **Validation Integration**: Prevents AI from hallucinating NPCs that don't exist
- **Cross-Module Consistency**: Maintains NPC continuity across different adventures

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed debug log file growing to 3GB+ due to exponential growth bug
- Fixed level up preserving current XP (was incorrectly resetting to 0)
- Fixed atlas caching bug preventing updates from showing
- Fixed NPC healing calculations not applying correctly
- Improved file locking and save error handling

#### Performance Stats (from actual usage)
- **Main system prompt**: ~93% token reduction
- **Combat messages**: ~70-85% compression rate
- **Validation messages**: ~60-75% compression rate

This is the first iteration of the compression system designed to reduce API costs and enable future local LLM deployment.
